## 🥅 Our Goal <a name = "goal"></a>
To reform the way of how web-development works by refactoring all of the tools that not just as a developer, but an average person (with no coding skills) needs to build a website. We combine these tools into a simple, concise tool that is globally accessible (FREE).  

## 📚 Basic Info <a name="basic-info"></a> 
The editor is built using `React` with `Typescript`, with a backend made with `NestJS`. This is a next-level editor, made to compete with the high ranks of wordpress and webflow, which allows people to build their websites for free, regardless of their coding skills.  If you want be the part of revoloutionizing the world of web-development, you are in the right place. Me and my brother have been started this project together and have been working on it consistently with our growing development team, which splits into 2 sub-teams. One team is working on the editor and the other is working on the `slobypy` python framework. I'm (gaborhadhazy) leading the editor developer team and my brother (Hels15) is leading the python framework project. 

## 📋 Describing the Editor <a name="editor-describing"></a>
In this case, Wordpress can be seen as a similar project that can be used to compare features. However, Sloby will not be your ordinary website builder, but a never seen before website building environment, that we will provide for people just like you. With its soothing atmosphere and unique features such as animation and high-quality customisations, we ensure that the developer experience is always our top priority. In addition, Sloby will contain a built-in coding development environment. For more experienced developers, we offer the `slobypy` Python framework, allowing you to design and mould your websites with pure Pythonic code and syntax throughout our editor. Did I mention that all of this is free? We will provide high-quality features such as real time project sharing and development, design sharing, automatic domain names and automated project deploys! Our main goal is to revouloutionize the world of web-development. One tool. One system. One Sloby.

3. Create your branch with your name and the feature that you are currently working on. *gaborhadhazy/authentication* 
4. Check this [Working Flow](#working-flow)
5. Make sure to keep in tocuh every with your teammates and discuss everything. :D

## 👨‍💻 Working flow <a name = "working-flow"></a>
We try to work in utmost efficiency. If our developers finish something like a global or something bigger will need to make a PR to the branch ***dev***,  and the teammates need to check what you've done so far and review your changes. We either will approve it and apply it to the dev branch, or we discuss more. Once your changes are implemented in the dev branch, we're gonna test it out and try to find as much bug as we can in our deployed site. Eventually at the end of each week we will merge the dev branch with the ***main*** *production* branch and that's it. 

 ***Tip***: Try to take advantages while in a PR, create issues and making it as clear as possible
