## 🥅 Our Goal <a name = "goal"></a>
To reform the way of how web-development works. Refactoring and taking all of the tools that not just as a developer but as an average person (with no coding skills) you need to build a website, and putting them into one single tool, which is FREE for everyone.  

## 📚 Basic Infos <a name="basic-infos"></a> 
The editor is built using React with Typescript, and in the backend using Nest Js. This is a next-level editor, which allows people to build their websites for free, regardless of their coding skills.  If you're wanna be the part of reforming the way of web-development, you are in the right place. Me and my brother have been started this project together and working on it consistently with our developer team, which splits into 2 teams. One team is working on the editor and the other working on the slobypy python framework. I'm (gaborhadhazy) leading the editor developer team and my brother (Hels15) is leading the python framework project. 

## 📋 Describing the Editor <a name="editor-describing"></a>
Most probably wondering about that, WordPress is the same as this project, let me clear this point for you. This will not be just a website, but an environment, that we will provide for people just like you. This is a  nicely formatted environment with unique features such as animation and high-quality customisations, also AI systems for coding, a built-in coding development environment, and other packages such as a python framework, which will allow you to make your websites with python code throughout our editor. On top of these features, we're making everything free. We will provide high-quality features such as sharing your project and working on it in real-time. You can also publish your project, where you can see all of the other people's projects, and you can download those projects and implement them as your own. You'll have a domain name registered in each project, so you don't have to worry about deploying your project manually anymore. If you're a developer you can implement your coding skills using our editor's built-in coding environment, and so on... Our main goal is to reform the way of how web-development works. We're gonna make a tool that'll be accessible for everyone, and make a global system that'll implement every coding and not coding feature in one place. Allowing everyone to make websites in their current situation, no matter whether they are developers or not, whether they have 0 skills in developing websites. One tool will solve every problem regarding of web-development.

1. You need to **add** something to the project and make a **PR**, just for us to make sure that you can work with us (We need to test you and trust you in the first place), however If you are already in the team ignore this step.
3. Create your branch with your name and the feature that you are currently working on. *gaborhadhazy/authentication* 
4. Check this [Working Flow](#working-flow)

## 👨‍💻 Working flow <a name = "working-flow"></a>
We work in a very efficient way. If our developers finish something like a global or something bigger will need to make a PR to the branch ***dev***,  and the teammates need to check what you've done so far and review your changes, We either will approve it and apply it to the dev branch, or we discuss more. Once your changes are implemented in the dev branch, we're gonna test it out and try to find as much bug as we can in our deployed site. Eventually at the end of each week we will merge the dev branch with the ***main*** *production* branch and that's it. 

 ***Tip***: Try to take advantages while in a PR, create issues and making it as clear as possible
