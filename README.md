The **next level** online editor the allows people to build their own websites without **no problem** .

## Our TECH Stack 
> We use `React` for the frontend and `FastAPI` to the backend. Both are very powerful and flexible when it comes to full-stack. 

#### React: 
> All of our editor and frontend logics is going to be done with `React`. **React** is a powerful javascript based frontend framework. React is very flexible and unique and perfect for us to performe a high quality user interface, with logics. And our editor logics is also going to be done with `React`. After all React is going to be the best choice for us when it comes to frontend logics. 

`If you are beginner` : Did you just start with **React** or **javascript**? Don't worry you still can work with us. You should have a basic understanding about react. I recommend start with a full-course `React` tutorial from freeCodeCamp, the video was created by John Smilga from Code Addict. You can acces the link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4&t=2s Once you do that, you should create some projects of apply your knowledge somehow. There is "Part 2" react Video also from Johh Smilga, in there you can build 15 project with the knwoledge that you've got. **Link in here** :  *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_7Z7C_JCyo&t=14458s*
