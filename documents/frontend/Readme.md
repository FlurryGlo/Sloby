# React for the FrontEnd

> So in the frontEnd, we use **React.js**. I have already discussed the advantages of React, in the root readme of our project structure (Read that first). 

## React installation basic project structure: 

###  **Node Installation**
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
> You'll definitely need node to be installed. Because of **npm** (node-package-manager). 


Open up a cmd and type: 
```
node -v
```
>That will check the version of node that you installed before. If you get something back like: **v16.16.0**, then you succesfully installed node. 


### **React Project Setup**

We use the regular react command to create and app:

```
npx create-react-app ./name
```
>  The **"./name"** refers to the project name you wanna call your application. 
> However if you already created a folder for it , then replace with this **"./"** that's gonna create it in the folder directly, and not create another folder for it

## **Our React App**
> This is what you get after creating a react app
